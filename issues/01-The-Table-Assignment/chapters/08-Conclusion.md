This problem of representing a table structure in Ruby which, at first glance, seemed straightforward turned out to be quite tricky in practice. This is borne out by the fact that many of the RMU students ended up taking very different approaches.

So why did we see this variety in the solutions? One factor is the native complexity of the problem itself. It requires finding a way of treating rows and columns as separate entities on the one hand, and on the other, maintaining their status as simply different views of the same data set.
 
Although we have discussed better and worse solutions, it is evident that there is no absolutely "right" solution. 

The goal of learning Ruby - or any other programming language - is not to produce perfect solutions, but rather to develop the ability to think out problems and to learn to ask the right questions.

The great benefit of the environment that has been created here at RMU is that students have ample opportunity to tackle difficult and multifaceted problems such as this one. This independent study is vital in developing a personal feel for problem solving in Ruby. But also instrumental in taking one to the next level is being able to see how one's peers have solved the exact same challenge.

We hope that you have enjoyed this paper as much as we've had writing it.

Special Thanks
