RMU Learning Series
===================

The Ruby Mendicant University (RMU) takes a problem-driven approach to teaching Ruby. During the core course students are given a set of assignments to solve. These assignments are posted publicly once the course is completed.

This Series examines actual solutions submitted by alumni to a particular problem. The purpose is to give an overview of the types of solutions presented and the reasoning that went into producing them.
